		<p><strong>Why I like it:</strong>I like this season for many reasons.The summer is a season of terrible heat.Everybody feels uneasy.During the rainy season the roads become muddy.There is water everywhere.People can not move easily.They face many difficulties.During the early autumn and late autumn these disadvantages do not wholly disappear.The winter also brings troubles.People shiver in cold.There is dense fog everywhere.The sun is hardly seen.The poor suffer a lot.But spring has none of these disadvantages.It has many attractive scenes and pleasant things.So I likethe season most.</p>

		<p><strong>Its arrival and duration:</strong> After winter the spring season comes with her lovely appearance.Spring is called the queen of seasons.It comes with pleasant sights and sounds.Fields and meadows become green.Flowers bloom in different trees.Birds sing from behind the new leaves.We hear cuckoo singing sweetly.There are village fairs on various occasion.During spring bees are busy in gathering honey.A gentle breeze blows.Everything looks gay and cheerful.It is also a season of fruits. Mango,black berry,jack fruit,lichies have buds on them.Farmers also sow the seeds of jute and paddy.</p>
